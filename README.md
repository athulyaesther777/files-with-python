## Example.py: Utilizing Text Files in Python
**File:** `example.py`
- Demonstrates how to read and manipulate data from text files.
- Utilizes `example.txt` and `test.txt` to extract and process information.
- Also shows how to use `game.csv` for similar purposes.

## Part2.py: Working with JSON in Python
**File:** `part2.py`
- Explores reading and writing JSON data.
- Shows how Python interacts with `data.json` for parsing and managing structured data.

## Part3.py: Integrating Python with JSON
**File:** `part3.py`
- Combines Python and JSON.
- Demonstrates complex data manipulations and integrations using `data.json` for various applications.

## Part4: Writing a File
- Demonstrates simple codes for writing files.
- Ensure that the text file or CSV file exists in the directory before running the code.

## Part5: System Commands
- For Windows, use the `dir` command to list files in the directory.

## Part 6 (basic 1) - Part 6 (basic 7)
- Before proceeding to Part 6 (Automatic Desktop), it is advisable to review Parts 6 (Basic 1) to 6 (Basic 7).
- Familiarizing yourself with these foundational concepts will enhance your understanding and effectiveness in navigating and implementing the content of Part 6 and Part 7.

## Part6: Automatic Desktop
- Provides a different experience while working on this code.
- Enhances the desktop automation process.

## Part7: Automatic Desktop Continuation
- Continuation of Part 6, providing further insights into desktop automation.

## Part 8 to Part 13: API and JSON
- Discusses APIs and JSON in Python.
- Explores how they work and how to implement them in various applications.

## Part14: SQLite with Python
- Covers the use of SQLite with Python.
- Demonstrates how to create, read, update, and delete data in SQLite databases using Python.

## Part15: Web Scraping
- Focuses on extracting data from websites.
- Demonstrates techniques for web scraping using Python.
